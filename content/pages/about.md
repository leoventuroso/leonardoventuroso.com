Hi, I'm Leonardo, 

I'm a data scientist, born and raised at the foot of Friulian Dolomites (Italy), now based in Trento (Italy). My work lies in the intersection of Machine Learning, Data, Sustainability, Software Engineering, and People. I'm in love with Technology, and how it can improve people's lives. 

In the past, I've worked in Publishing, Public Institutions and Tech Consulting. The common thread? Solving problems end-to-end. 

My work is also shaped by my background and education. I've studied at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), with also summer term spent at the [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), and fall term at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

In my free time, you can probably find me writing novels, [climbing]({static}/images/climb.jpg), reading or playing the guitar.

If you wish to know more about my career, feel free to browse [my resume]({static}/pdfs/cv.pdf). 

To get in touch, just email me: leo.venturoso@gmail.com
